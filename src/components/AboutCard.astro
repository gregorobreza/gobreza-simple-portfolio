      <h3>What have I been up to lately</h3>
      <p>
        Since on the day job I mostly do front-end development, I work on my
        back-end skills through building side projects in my spare time. Apart
        from that I am also interested into business, startups and Saas
        development. Therefore I am exploring and learning about how to market
        market some of my ideas.

      <h3>Some other facts</h3>
      <p>
        Actually, I completed my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering and
        ventured into programming and web development during the final stages of
        my studies. Even though I am not so into mechanical engineering anymore,
        I still like to model and 3D print some ideas from time to time...

      <h3>Random</h3>
      <p>
        Yes I also do other stuff in my life ðŸ™ƒ. I enjoy hard strongman and
        powerlifting training sessions, boxing, reading, having a beer or two
        with my friends and of course spending time and building our future with
        my girlfriend.
