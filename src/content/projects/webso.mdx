import WorkInProgress from "../../components/WorkInProgress.astro";

This is simple static website I created a while ago but I still think it looks
preety cool.

## Used stuff

1. **HTML, SCSS, JS**: no framework just basic stuff.

2. **GSAP**: for some simple animations.

3. **fullPage.js**: library for full page transitions.

## Why was this page created?

This page is from a while ago and it is actually a landing page for a small
WordPress agency I and my cousin were running a couple of years ago... This is
also the reason that it is in Slovenian language. At the time I was quite new
into web development. Then I was more or less working on development of simple
static landing pages.

## Process of making it

- Font and color scheme selection.
- Created design in figma.
- Website development.
- Deploy on Netlify.

## What I learned

I learned the basics of working with animation library and writing CSS in SASS
style. I also learned a lot about working with \*.svg files since I prepared all
the assets for the page.

Even tought looking back to this website it seem like nothing special it is in
some way special for me since it sparked interes in me to get deeper into my web
development journey.
