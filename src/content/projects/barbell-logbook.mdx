This landing page was made with intention of validating one of my app ideas. The
main point of this landing page was to run some ads on facebook and google and
see if there is any interest for such solution and what is the main audience.

## The stuff I used

1. **Next.js**: the React framework.

2. **Mantine**: a fully featured React componet library.

3. **TypeScript**: for faster development.

4. **Nodemailer**: for simple email sending.

5. **Google Sheeds API**: for recording submited forms.

## Process of making it

- Selecting images and color scheme.
- Figma design.
- Basic look and functionalities.
- Added some animations using Framer motion.
- Google Tag and cookie notice configuration.

In general creating this website using Next.js and Mantine component library was
prety straight forward since I am quite used to use them togeether.

What was a bit new to me was proppery implementing cookie notice and GoogleTag
manager into project so the user can opt-out any time. Once GoogleTag was added,
I connected Google Analytics and Facebook Pixels. At the end of the day it was
nothig special just a bit of testing to get it working. However I found Google
Tag manager development tool a bit clunky and not really reliable.

The final thing was implementing form so users can sign up for early access.
Since that was only a landing page for testing an idea I didn't really want to
add some sort of database complexity to it. Therefore for tracing users
responses I simply used Google Sheeds API and recorded their answer. I also send
nice email (created with React Email library) to the user on succesfull form
submition.

That was prety much it. The final touch was adding Google reCAPTCHA v3 to
evalute if user is a robot so I didn't get some random form submitions from
bots.

## What I learned

I was more or less speedrunnign this landing page since I wanted to evaluate my
idea as fast as possible to get to development of real application. At the end I
decided I won't develop this idea further since other things came along. I still
learned a lot and I do like how the page turned out.
